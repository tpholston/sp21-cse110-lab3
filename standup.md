## Standup Notes

- Person: Tyler Holston
	- last: 
        - I worked on creating the html foundation for the journal site
	- next: 
        - Plan to work on the CSS for the journal site to style the page
	- blockers: 
        - not really any blockers. Perhaps in vague terms the agile process but it's a work in progress rather than a blocker
    

## Discussions

- just internal dialogue regarding the styling of the journal page. Color palletes and all that garbage.s
