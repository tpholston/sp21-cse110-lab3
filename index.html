                    <p>
                        Today I went to the grocery store and I got a lot of stuff! I went to Ralph's with my friends and we decided to that we were going to stock up on food for the next couple of weeks so we got a <strong>ton </strong>of
                        food. It was really fun we decided that while we were in the area we would go to Chipotle and I got a burrito. The queso is so fire so if you get the chance to try it you need to. We were thinking about going to see
                        a movie as well but after I lost so much money on <i>AMC</i> stock we decided that we wouldn't support their business.

                    <p>
                        I have been working on a project for cse135 trying to get my server up and running. I was stuck on a part but I reached out to some of the TA's in the class that were super helpful. Also I didn't realize how many
                        people were having the same issues as me because whenever I looked anything up on the internet like 10-15 different stack overflow posts would come up with people asking similar questions to mine. Anyways, I finally
                        got everything working and I found this really cool gif that was literally me when I got everything working.

                    <p>I went to the beach with some friends and took some pictures. It was really peaceful there so I captured some audio so I can sleep to it tonight perhaps. I went with my friends and we all brought some stuff:</p>
                    <ul class="listBrought">
                        <li class="flex-item">Surfboards</li>
                        <li class="flex-item">Boogieboards</li>

                        <li class="flex-item">Volleyball</li>
                        <li class="flex-item">Chips</li>
                        <li class="flex-item">Water</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        We had such a great time it was a blast! I tried to help my friend Tien learn how to surf and I did my best to break down the steps for him. He managed to get up on his knees and ride the wave. It was super cool to
                        see how excited his success made him. I told him to do this:
